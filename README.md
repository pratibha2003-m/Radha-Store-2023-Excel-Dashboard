# Radha Store – 2023 Excel Dashboard

This repo contains a clean Excel dashboard I built to review Radha Store’s 2023 performance. The goal was simple: put revenue, expenses, profit and sales trends in one place so owners/managers can see what matters at a glance.

## What’s inside
- **Radha_Store_2023_Dashboard.xlsx** – main workbook with data, calculations and the Dashboard sheet.
- **reports/Radha_Store_2023_Report.pdf** – short report with the final visuals and key takeaways.
- **images/** – a few screenshots for quick preview.

## What it shows
- **Financial overview:** total revenue, total expenses, and net profit
- **Sales performance:** monthly trend + top products
- **Expense breakdown:** category-wise view
- **At-a-glance KPIs:** quick cards for important numbers

## How it’s built
- Properly structured data (months, products, categories)
- Formulas used: `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `% change`, running totals
- Conditional formatting to flag loss/low margin
- Charts: line (sales trend), bar (top products), pie (expense split)
- A single **Dashboard** sheet for stakeholders

## How to use
1. Open the Excel file and go to the **Dashboard** sheet.
2. Use slicers/filters to explore months and product categories.
3. For details, check the source sheets and calculations.

## Why this repo
I wanted a straightforward, real-work style example: clear numbers, tidy visuals, and a PDF summary. No fluff—just a dashboard that answers “How did we do in 2023?” in seconds.
